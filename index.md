I study the formation and evolution of galaxies through large-scale simulations of stellar dynamics and chemical enrichment.  
My work focuses on understanding how stars migrate, mix, and carry the chemical fingerprints of the Milky Wayâ€™s history.

Currently, Iâ€™m developing **chemodynamical models** of disk evolution using the **NEXUS** simulation framework â€” combining the gravity solver **RAMSES**, the potential modeling code **AGAMA**, and custom analysis pipelines optimized for **high-performance computing** environments.

I also apply **machine learning techniques** to stellar survey data (e.g., **GALAH DR4**) to infer stellar ages from chemical abundances â€” an approach that links statistical inference with galactic archaeology.

### ðŸ§  Research Interests
- Galactic archaeology & chemical evolution  
- Stellar dynamics & radial migration  
- HPC methods in astrophysical simulations  
- Physics-informed machine learning  
- Data-driven stellar age inference

### ðŸ”­ Outreach & Education
Beyond research, I lead public engagement through the **Lunar Sooners Astronomy Outreach Organization**, organizing star parties, telescope training, and educational programs for Kâ€“12 students and the general public.  
Iâ€™m passionate about making the night sky accessible and inspiring curiosity through hands-on experiences.
